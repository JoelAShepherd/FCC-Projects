   <h2>Books</h2>
   <p> NT Wright is a prolific writer with the (somewhat unusual) ability to write material for a broad range of audiances. Books such as those from the  "... for everyone" series (and other published under the name Tom wright) are written to be easily understood and to unpack the bible in a way that makes sense to people without any scholarly or theological training. Books published under the name NT Wright dig deeper into theological issues and explore them more thoroughly, ranging from the popular "<a href="https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/trevin-wax/book-review-surprised-by-hope/" target="_blank">Surprised by Hope</a>" to the magisterial "<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/70497-christian-origins-and-the-question-of-god" target="_blank">Christian Origins and the Question of God</a>" series.</p>
