        <header><h2>Introduction</h2></header>
        <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive (e.g., having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.).  There are also more advanced server side versions of JavaScript such as Node.js, which allow you to add more functionality to a website than simply downloading files (such as realtime collaboration between multiple computers). Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
        <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Client-side JavaScript</b> extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its <i>Document Object Model</i> (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
          <li><b>Server-side JavaScript</b> extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This means that in the browser, JavaScript can change the way the webpage (DOM) looks. And, likewise, Node.js JavaScript on the server can respond to custom requests from code written in the browser.</p>

        <header><h2>JavaScript and Java</h2></header>
        <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
        <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>
        <p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.</p>
        <p>Java is a class-based programming language designed for fast execution and type safety. Type safety means, for instance, that you can't cast a Java integer into an object reference or access private memory by corrupting Java bytecodes. Java's class-based model means that programs consist exclusively of classes and their methods. Java's class inheritance and strong typing generally require tightly coupled object hierarchies. These requirements make Java programming more complex than JavaScript programming.</p>
        <p>In contrast, JavaScript descends in spirit from a line of smaller, dynamically typed languages such as HyperTalk and dBASE. These scripting languages offer programming tools to a much wider audience because of their easier syntax, specialized built-in functionality, and minimal requirements for object creation.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="javascript_and_the_ecmascript_specification">
        <header><h2>JavaScript and the ECMAScript specification</h2></header>
        <p>JavaScript is standardized at Ecma International — the European association for standardizing information and communication systems (ECMA was formerly an acronym for the European Computer Manufacturers Association) to deliver a standardized, international programming language based on JavaScript. This standardized version of JavaScript, called ECMAScript, behaves the same way in all applications that support the standard. Companies can use the open standard language to develop their implementation of JavaScript. The ECMAScript standard is documented in the ECMA-262 specification. See New in JavaScript to learn more about different versions of JavaScript and ECMAScript specification editions.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="basics">
        <header><h2>Basics</h2></header>
        <p>JavaScript borrows most of its syntax from Java, C, and C++, but it has also been influenced by Awk, Perl, and Python.</p>
        <p>JavaScript is <b>case-sensitive</b> and uses the <b>Unicode</b> character set. For example, the word Früh (which means "early" in German) could be used as a variable name.</p>
        <div class="outer">
          <code>  <!-- 'code' tag added to satify FCC checking system,
                  used originaly in code with 'pre' tag but these
                 tags prevented the text being responsive.-->
          <div class="inner">
            <p class="code">
            1|  let Früh = "foobar"
            </p>
          </div>
        </code>
        </div>
        <p>But, the variable früh is not the same as Früh because JavaScript is case sensitive.</p>
        <p>In JavaScript, instructions are called statements and are separated by semicolons (;).</p>
        <p>A semicolon is not necessary after a statement if it is written on its own line. But if more than one statement on a line is desired, then they must be separated by semicolons.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="comments">
        <header><h2>Comments</h2></header>
        <p>The syntax of <b>comments</b> is the same as in C++ and in many other languages:</p>
        <div class="outer">
          <code>
          <div class="inner">
            <p class="code">
            1|  // a one line comment<br>
            2|<br>
            3|  /* this is a longer,<br>
            4|   * multi-line comment<br>
            5|   */<br>
            6|<br>
            7|  /* You can't, however, /* nest comments */ SyntaxError */
            </p>
          </div>
        </code>
        </div>
        <p>Comments behave like whitespace, and are discarded during script execution.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="declarations">
        <header><h2>Declarations</h2></header>
        <p>JavaScript has three kinds of variable declarations:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b><i><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var" target="_blank">var</a></b></i> - Declares a variable, optionally initializing it to a value.</li>
          <li><b><i><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let" target="_blank">let</a></b></i> - Declares a block-scoped, local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.</li>
          <li><b><i><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const" target="_blank">const</a></b></i> - Declares a block-scoped, read-only named constant.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="evaluating_variables">
        <header><h2>Evaluating variables</h2></header>
        <p>A variable declared using the <mark>var</mark> or <mark>let</mark> statement with no assigned value specified has the value of <mark>undefined</mark>.</p>
        <p>An attempt to access an undeclared variable results in a <mark>ReferenceError</mark> exception being thrown:</p>
        <div class="outer">
          <code>
          <div class="inner">
            <p class="code">
            1|  var a;<br>
            2|  console.log('The value of a is ' + a);<br>
            3|  // The value of a is undefined<br>
            4|<br>
            5|  console.log('The value of b is ' + b);<br>
            6|  var b;<br>
            7|  // The value of b is undefined<br>
            8|<br>
            9|  console.log('The value of c is ' + c);<br>
           10|  // Uncaught ReferenceError: c is not defined<br>
           11|<br>
           12|  let x;<br>
           13|  console.log('The value of x is ' + x);<br>
           14|  // The value of x is undefined<br>
           15|<br>
           16|  console.log('The value of y is ' + y);<br>
           17|  let y;<br>
           18|  // Uncaught ReferenceError: y is not defined
            </p>
          </div>
          </code>
        </div>
        <p>You can use <mark>undefined</mark> to determine whether a variable has a value. In the following code, the variable <mark>input</mark> is not assigned a value, and the <mark>if</mark> statement evaluates to <mark>true</mark>.</p>
        <div class="outer">
          <code>
          <div class="inner">
            <p class="code">
            1|  var input;<br>
            2|  if (input === undefined) {<br>
            3|    doThis();<br>
            4|  } else {<br>
            5|    doThat();<br>
            6|  }
            </p>
          </div>
        </code>
        </div>
        <p>The <mark>undefined</mark> value behaves as <mark>false</mark> when used in a boolean context. For example, the following code executes the function <mark>myFunction</mark> because the <mark>myArray</mark> element is <mark>undefined</mark>:</p>
        <div class="outer">
          <code>
          <div class="inner">
            <p class="code">
            1|  var myArray = [];<br>
            2|  if (!myArray[0]) myFunction();
            </p>
          </div>
          <code>
        </div>
        <p>The <mark>undefined</mark> value converts to <mark>NaN</mark> when used in numeric context.</p>
        <div class="outer">
          <code>
          <div class="inner">
            <p class="code">
            1|  var a;<br>
            2|  a + 2;  // Evaluates to NaN
            </p>
          </div>
        </code>
        </div>
        <p>When you evaluate a <mark>null</mark> variable, the null value behaves as <mark>0</mark> in numeric contexts and as <mark>false</false> in boolean contexts. For example:</p>
        <div class="outer">
          <code>
          <div class="inner">
            <p class="inner">
            1|  var n = null;<br>
            2|  console.log(n * 32); // Will log 0 to the console
            </p>
          </div>
        </code>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="variable_scope">
        <header><h2>Variable scope</h2></header>
        <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.</p>
        <p>JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope. Rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within.</p>
        <p>For example, the following code will log <mark>5</mark>, because the scope of <mark>x</mark> is the global context (or the function context if the code is part of a function). The scope of <mark>x</mark> is not limited to the immediate <mark>if</mark> statement block.</p>
        <div class="outer">
          <code>
          <div class="inner">
            <p class="code">
            1|  if (true) {<br>
            2|  var x = 5;<br>
            3|  }<br>
            4|  console.log(x);  // x is 5<br>
            </p>
          </div>
        </code>
        </div>
        <p>This behavior changes when using the <mark>let</mark> declaration (introduced in ECMAScript 2015).</p>
        <div class="outer">
          <code>
          <div class="inner">
            <p class="code">
            1|  if (true) {<br>
            2|  let y = 5;<br>
            3|  }<br>
